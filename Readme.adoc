A few slides for a short talk about quarkus and why I think it is a good alternative to the widely used Spring Boot.

I'm using this project also to learn how to create slides from asciidoc using an automated GitHub build.

The https://joemat.github.io/quarkus-as-alternative-to-spring-slides/[generated slides are hosted on GitHub pages].

The script link:render.sh[render.sh] runs the
https://hub.docker.com/r/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor[asciidoctor docker container] to generate the slides.
